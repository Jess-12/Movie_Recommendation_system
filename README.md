# Movie_Recommendation_system

From a user’s perspective, they are catered to fulfil the user’s needs in the shortest time possible. For example, the type of content you watch on Netflix or Hulu. A person who likes to watch only Korean drama will see titles related to that only but a person who likes to watch Action-based titles will see that on their home screen.

From an organization’s perspective, they want to keep the user as long as possible on the platform so that it will generate the most possible profit for them. With better recommendations, it creates positive feedback from the user as well. What good it will be to the organization to have a library of 500K+ titles when they cannot provide proper recommendations?
